Develop an AI-driven Mental Health Support System that uses transformer-based NLP models for sentiment analysis, emotion classification, and context-aware dialogue generation. The system should analyze user text inputs to detect psychological states such as stress, anxiety, loneliness, or burnout, and generate supportive, non-judgmental responses.

Integrate modules for:

Real-time emotion detection

Personalized intervention recommendations

Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)–inspired techniques

Risk assessment for crisis situations

Longitudinal mood analytics

The application should prioritize ethical AI principles including transparency, bias mitigation, data privacy, and human-in-the-loop escalation for high-risk cases. The final solution should demonstrate measurable improvements in user well-being through engagement metrics and feedback analysis.
